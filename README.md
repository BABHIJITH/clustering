📌 Project Title: Instagram Visits Clustering Analysis

🎯 Objective: Apply various clustering techniques to group users based on Instagram visit scores and spending ranks.

🚀 Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering – Groups data into predefined clusters using centroids.
- K-Medoids Clustering – Robust to outliers, using actual data points instead of centroids.
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering – Merges points iteratively to form a hierarchy.
- Single Linkage Clustering – Links clusters based on closest points, forming chain-like structures.
- Complete Linkage Clustering – Ensures tight, well-separated clusters by merging based on farthest points.

📊 Results & Findings
Each clustering method was applied to Instagram visit scores vs. spending rank data.
🔹 K-Means & K-Medoids formed well-defined clusters, showing user segmentation trends.
🔹 Agglomerative Clustering revealed hierarchical relationships within the dataset.
🔹 Single Linkage Hierarchy resulted in elongated, connected clusters.
🔹 Complete Linkage Hierarchy provided more compact, distinct groups.



🎨 Visualizations
Each clustering technique generates scatter plots and dendrograms for hierarchical clustering. 📈
🔹 K-Means & K-Medoids highlight customer segmentation trends
🔹 Hierarchical Clustering shows how users connect based on engagement

💡 Conclusion
Understanding user behavior helps businesses optimize marketing strategies and target audiences effectively. Different clustering techniques give unique insights, ranging from defined groups to natural hierarchies.
